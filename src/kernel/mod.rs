//! Vector kernels and backend selection.
//!
//! Layout of this module:
//!
//! - [`Backend`] — which instruction set the kernels will use, detected once
//!   per process.
//! - [`FieldKernels`] — the per-field kernel contract. GF(2^8) and GF(2^16)
//!   own hand-written SIMD dispatch; wider and Fan–Paar fields use the
//!   portable `scalar` kernels.
//! - `scalar` — the portable reference and fallback implementation. Every
//!   SIMD backend is differentially tested against it, and vector loops use
//!   it for sub-lane tails.
//! - `x86` / `aarch64` / `wasm32` — architecture-local intrinsics.
//!
//! Callers should use the safe, validated wrappers in [`crate::ops`] rather
//! than this module directly.
