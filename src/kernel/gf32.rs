//! GF(2^32) kernel dispatch.
//!
//! On GFNI x86 a GF(2^32) multiply is the level-2 tower identity of
//! [`crate::kernel::gf16`]: two GF(2^16) lane multiplies under a period-2
//! coefficient, each itself two byte-wide multiplies — four `GF2P8MULB`
//! per 32-byte lane. Everywhere else the portable scalar kernel applies.
//! The trait defaults compose every multi-row and prepared operation from
//! [`FieldKernels::mul_add`], so the GFNI win reaches scatter/gather/matrix
//! over a prepared [`crate::ops::Plan`] without a per-shape kernel.
