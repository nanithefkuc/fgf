# Benchmarks

`fgf` uses small custom benchmark binaries rather than a statistical harness.
They print throughput directly so operation shape, row size, and backend remain
visible beside each result.

## Reproduce

```sh
cargo bench --bench kernels
cargo bench --bench compare
```

Pin a weaker backend to measure a dispatch crossover (commands recorded with
the historical `FFF_BACKEND`; the override is now `SIMD_BACKEND`, owned by
[`simdispatch`](https://github.com/nanithefkuc/simdispatch), with the tiers
renamed: `avx2`→`v3`, `ssse3`→`v2`):

```sh
SIMD_BACKEND=v3  cargo bench --bench kernels
SIMD_BACKEND=v2 cargo bench --bench kernels
SIMD_BACKEND=scalar cargo bench --bench kernels
```

Non-x86 targets need a runner. The `aarch64` and `wasm32` kernels were
measured with these:

```sh
# aarch64, on an adb-connected arm64 device (cargo-ndk):
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build --release --bench kernels
adb push target/aarch64-linux-android/release/deps/kernels-<hash> /data/local/tmp/
adb shell 'cd /data/local/tmp && taskset 80 ./kernels-<hash>'

# wasm32, under Node's WASI shim:
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+simd128" \
  cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 --bench kernels
node wasi-run.mjs target/wasm32-wasip1/release/deps/kernels-<hash>.wasm
```

`wasi-run.mjs` is the whole shim (the same one works as
`CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_WASIP1_RUNNER` for `cargo test --target wasm32-wasip1`):

```js
import { WASI } from "node:wasi";
import { argv, env, exit } from "node:process";
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

const [wasmPath, ...rest] = argv.slice(2);
const wasi = new WASI({ version: "preview1", args: [wasmPath, ...rest], env,
                        preopens: { "/": "/" }, returnOnExit: true });
const module = await WebAssembly.compile(await readFile(wasmPath));
exit(wasi.start(await WebAssembly.instantiate(module, wasi.getImportObject())));
```

Both runners are far noisier than a pinned desktop CPU, so a single pair of
runs proves nothing:

- On a phone, `taskset` to **one** big core, not the cluster: migration
  between cores produces a bimodal distribution (two clean clusters ~1.5x
  apart), and a whole run can land in either mode.
- Under Node, tiering and GC shift results by up to 40% run to run.
- Interleave the two binaries (`base, new, base, new, …`), take the **maximum**
  of at least three runs per key, and always include an unchanged operation as
  a control. Every number below was accepted only with its control at 1.00x.

Record the CPU, operating system, Rust version, selected backend, row size, row
count, and source count with any quoted result. `backend_for::<F>()` matters
for the wider towers and Fan–Paar family: GF(2^32)/GF(2^64) use GFNI on
x86 GFNI hosts, the canonical Fan–Paar GF(2^16)/32/64 use AVX2/SSSE3 on x86,
but FanPaar8, SSSE3 for the wider Fan–Paar fields, and every shuffle-only
backend still report the portable kernels even when the process-wide backend
is `avx512` or `gfni`.

## Interpreting the shapes

- `mul_add` is the single-row AXPY baseline.
- `mul_add_scatter` tests source-load sharing across destination rows.
- `mul_add_gather` and `mul_add_matrix` test whether destination tiles stay in
  registers across sources.
- `_with` operations separate coefficient preparation from byte-loop cost.
- `mul_elementwise` has no broadcast coefficient. It vectorizes on
  AVX-512/GFNI (native `GF2P8MULB`) and, via a branchless shift/reduce vector
  multiply, on AVX2/SSSE3, NEON, and Wasm `simd128`. Measured on a Core Ultra
  7 258V (Linux, rustc 1.93), 256 KiB buffers: gf8 0.78 → 7.97 GiB/s (AVX2)
  and 2.62 GiB/s (SSSE3); gf16 0.43 → 4.39 GiB/s (AVX2) and 1.48 GiB/s
  (SSSE3). The wider fields still use the scalar reference.

Small GF(2^16) rows are sensitive to coefficient preparation because a shuffle
backend builds four nibble tables per coefficient. Use `Coeff` or `Plan` when a
coding matrix is reused. Large rows amortize the same setup in the byte loop.
GF(2^8) preparation is free at every size — its 256-entry table bank is static
— and GFNI preparation is two broadcast words, so the effect is a shuffle-
backend GF(2^16) concern only.

`bench_preparation_crossover` in `benches/kernels.rs` measures exactly where
that stops mattering, one-shot against prepared over 16 B … 64 KiB rows. Run
it rather than quoting a remembered threshold; on a hybrid CPU pin the process
(`taskset -c <p-core>`) or the two core types will produce two answers.

`bench_blocked_vs_axpy` measures the blocked multi-row GF(2^16) kernels
against repeated single-row AXPY by calling both directly, bypassing dispatch.
It needs the `internals` feature (`cargo bench --bench kernels --features
internals`) and is the harness to rerun before changing which shape a backend
dispatches to.

`bench_small_row_shapes` measures the GF(2^16) multi-row shapes at row lengths
where a coefficient's four nibble tables are still a visible share of the work,
with a coefficient set that is one-fifth zeros and one-fifth ones so the
zero/one specializations are exercised. It also times fused `mul_into` against
the copy-then-scale it replaces.

`bench_large_destination` measures `mul_into` at 1, 8 and 32 MiB. Past 2 MiB
the x86 kernels store the destination non-temporally, which skips the
read-for-ownership fetch of lines they overwrite whole; the cost is that the
destination is not left cached, so the section also times an
encode-then-read-back loop, and `mul_add` as a control the change cannot touch.
Rerun it before moving that threshold, and pin the process: the effect is
entirely memory-side, so an unpinned run on a hybrid CPU reports the wrong
size at which it starts paying.

`bench_destination_alignment` measures multi-row scatter with the destination
at 32-byte residues 0 and 16. The GFNI and AVX2 kernels peel a row group's
lead-in so the rest of the pass is aligned; a single allocator-fresh buffer
cannot show that effect, because its residue never varies. Read the two skews
against each other, and keep an unchanged field (GF(2^8) here, when only the
GF(2^16) kernels changed) as a drift control.

## aarch64 and wasm32 kernel numbers (2026-07-31)

Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (`arm64-v8a`, Android, rustc 1.93, backend `neon`), one big
core, maximum of four interleaved runs, GF(2^8) buffers as control (1.00x):

| Shape | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gf16 `mul_add`, 4 KiB … 8 MiB | 2.09–2.17 GiB/s | 2.30–2.41 GiB/s (+11%) |
| gf16 `mul_assign`, ≤ 256 KiB | 2.30–2.35 GiB/s | 2.39–2.45 GiB/s (+4%) |
| gf16 `mul_into`, 16 KiB rows | copy-then-scale | fused, +6% over copy+scale |

The gf16 two-lane unroll is what moves `mul_add`; it wins at every size from
4 KiB to 8 MiB on a pinned core. Measured on the *cluster* instead, the same
binary reports anything from 0.65x to 1.11x — that spread is core migration,
not the kernel.

### PMULL against the nibble shuffle

`Backend::NeonAes` (was `Pmull`) and `Backend::Neon` differ by dispatch alone,
so `SIMD_BACKEND=neon_aes` against `SIMD_BACKEND=neon` in **one binary** is
the cleanest A/B this crate has (recorded with the historical
`FFF_BACKEND=pmull`/`neon`). Same device, one pinned big core, max of three
runs each:

| Shape | `neon` | `pmull` | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gf8 `mul_elementwise`, 4 KiB … 8 MiB | 0.83 GiB/s | 1.28–1.30 GiB/s | **1.55x** |
| gf16 `mul_elementwise`, 4 KiB … 8 MiB | 0.39–0.41 GiB/s | 0.36 GiB/s | 0.88–0.92x |
| gf8 `mul_add` fixed coefficient | 9.0–9.2 GiB/s | 1.17–1.23 GiB/s | 0.13x |
| gf16 `mul_add` fixed coefficient | 2.4 GiB/s | 0.62 GiB/s | 0.26x |

Only the first line survived into dispatch. `PMULL` pays when it replaces
eight bit-serial rounds; against `vqtbl1q_u8`'s five instructions it cannot
carry its twenty-instruction reduction network, and against the tower's
three-multiply identity it merely ties. The losing kernels were deleted, with
the numbers kept in `src/kernel/aarch64/`.

Everything else in the run matches within 3% — except rows of 16–128 B, where
dispatch-identical code varied by up to 1.36x between the two runs. Treat
anything measured on rows that small as noise unless it survives many runs.

Node 26 WASI (`wasm32-wasip1`, `simd128`, rustc 1.93), maximum of four
interleaved runs, GF(2^8) `xor`/`elementwise` as control (1.00x):

| Shape | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gf16 `mul_add`, 4 KiB … 8 MiB | 4.5–5.4 GiB/s | 5.6–6.1 GiB/s (+13–24%) |
| gf16 `mul_assign`, 4 KiB … 8 MiB | 5.0–5.2 GiB/s | 6.0–6.2 GiB/s (+14–25%) |
| gf16 `scatter`, 16 rows, ≥ 256 B | 4.4–5.1 GiB/s | 9.8–11.1 GiB/s (~2.1x) |
| gf16 `gather`, 8 sources, ≥ 256 B | 4.5–5.4 GiB/s | 7.5–9.1 GiB/s (~1.7x) |
| gf16 `matrix`, 16x8, ≥ 256 B | 4.8–5.0 GiB/s | 6.2–7.9 GiB/s (1.3–1.6x) |

The multi-row factors come from hoisting the four-table derivation out of the
per-`(term, row)` loop and skipping zero/one coefficients; at 64 B rows the
result is inside Node's noise band. A two-lane unroll of the *GF(2^8)* wasm
kernels measured 1.00x and was therefore not kept: two swizzles per lane leave
no latency to hide, unlike GF(2^16)'s eight.

## Crossover and dispatch decisions

Several kernels are wired one way rather than another because of a
measurement. The code at each site states the decision and the reason; the
numbers behind it are here, so that re-deriving them is a matter of rerunning
a benchmark rather than trusting a comment.

Unless noted otherwise: Core Ultra 7 258V, Linux, rustc 1.93, one core,
maximum of interleaved runs with an unaffected operation as a 1.00x control.

### Non-temporal stores in `mul_into` (`kernel::x86::NT_STORE_MIN`)

`mul_into` never reads its destination, so an ordinary store pays a
read-for-ownership fetch of every line it fully overwrites. `vmovntdq` skips
it, at the price of evicting the destination. GF(2^8) `mul_into`, ordinary
stores → non-temporal:

| Destination | Write-only | Encode then read back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 MiB | 32.3 → 61.2 GiB/s | 21.6 → 17.9 GiB/s |
| 2 MiB | 21.3 → 66.0 | 16.5 → 16.9 |
| 4 MiB | 21.5 → 37.8 | 14.5 → 16.1 |
| 16 MiB | 16.1 → 34.4 | 10.7 → 12.9 |
| 64 MiB | 14.2 → 23.0 | — |

2 MiB (this host's L3 is 12 MiB) is where the read-back workload stops losing
while the write-only one is already ~3x, which is why the threshold sits
there. The forced `avx2` and `ssse3` arms hit the same ~14 GiB/s ceiling at
16 MiB, so every backend is store-bound at that size, not multiply-bound.
`mul_assign` reads its destination anyway and measures 22.0 GiB/s either way
at 64 MiB, 0.5x at 256 KiB — it keeps ordinary stores.

**Not taken:** GF(2^16) on SSSE3. Eight `PSHUFB` per 16 bytes hold that loop
to ~5.9 GiB/s, well under the host's write bandwidth, and 16-byte
non-temporal stores from a slow loop flush write-combining buffers before a
line fills: 5.41/5.44 GiB/s ordinary against 4.84/4.79 non-temporal at
32 MiB. The GF(2^8) SSSE3 kernel does reach the ceiling (19.7 GiB/s) and does
use them.

### Destination alignment peel (`kernel::x86::peel_to_align`)

A 32-byte `vmovdqu` at an odd multiple of 32 straddles two cache lines, and a
multi-row body issues one load and one store per row per vector. On GF(2^8)
64 KiB rows the aligned form runs ~1.4x the misaligned one. Peeling at most
31 bytes per row group buys the aligned body for the rest of the pass. The
2 KiB floor comes from the original all-scalar GF(2^8) peel, which won from
about 2 KiB up and lost badly below 1 KiB.

Generalized to the GF(2^16) scatter kernels, normalized against untouched
GF(2^8) rows as a control, 8 rows, misaligned destination:

| Kernel | 64 KiB rows | 256 KiB rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gf16 scatter, GFNI | 1.30–1.36x | 1.23–1.30x |
| gf16 scatter, AVX2 | 1.03–1.11x | 1.03–1.11x |

An already-aligned destination is unchanged.

**Not taken:** the GF(2^16) matrix kernel (0.96–1.03x at 64 KiB, 0.93–1.01x
at 256 KiB — its row tile is stored once per term block, not per source
window) and the SSSE3 scatter (1–3% slower; 16-byte accesses never straddle a
line at the alignment allocators already give).

### Blocking against repeated AXPY

Register-blocked multi-row kernels are not universally better than dispatching
to repeated single-row AXPY, so dispatch picks per `(field, backend, shape)`.
Across 2–16 sources and 4–64 KiB rows, blocked against AXPY:

| Shape | Result | Wired to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gf16 gather, GFNI | 1.03–1.59x | blocked |
| gf16 gather, SSSE3 | 1.5–1.8x | blocked |
| gf16 gather, AVX2 | 0.84–1.01x | AXPY |
| gf16 matrix, AVX2 | 0.95–1.20x | AXPY |
| gf8 matrix, AVX2 | +20% | blocked |

AVX2 loses on GF(2^16) because it has enough width but not enough registers to
retain several four-table coefficient sets, and because a gather's
coefficients are one-to-one with its sources — a source's nibble split feeds
exactly one coefficient, so there is nothing to share. SSSE3's smaller table
vectors fit. The AVX2 matrix wins only at or below ~8 KiB rows, which is not
enough to justify a row-length branch in dispatch. Before its broadcasts were
hoisted out of the byte loop, the GFNI gather ran at 0.29–0.47x, which is why
dispatch previously avoided it.

### Zero-coefficient skipping in the blocked GF(2^8) matrix kernel

Not done: coefficients have to reach a general-purpose register to be tested,
which stops each factor broadcast from folding into a memory-operand
`vpbroadcastb`. Over eight terms and 64 KiB rows the check cost ~9%. Sparsity
is handled in the scatter shape instead, which drops zero rows before grouping
and outside any loop.

## Comparative benchmark

`benches/compare.rs` compares compatible GF(2^8) operations against
`reed-solomon-erasure` with its `simd-accel` feature. It is a development
comparison, not a claim that the crates expose identical abstractions. Run it
on the same machine and toolchain before quoting a ratio.

Historical measurements from local development are intentionally not copied
into the crate landing page: results without their original CPU and command
line are not reproducible evidence.
